# Process
Since I had some experience with frontend web development and React, the majority of the learning curve was learning the structure of the database, the server, and how they all interacted with each other. While learning how all these different components interact and connect, I was able to learn a bunch of new software like CORS, which is a Nodejs middleware, axios for making API calls, and Expressjs for GET and POST requests. I also learned about creating schemas and how storing things in databases work. The one new thing that I decided to try for the frontend this time was the Button and Form components from Bootstrap.

# How to Install
1. Install Repository
2. Run 'npm i' in the root directory of the project as well as in the client directory.
3. Make sure you have MongoDB installed.
4. Run 'npm start' in the client directory to start the React webpage, and run 'npm run serve' in the root directory to start the server.

# To-Do
